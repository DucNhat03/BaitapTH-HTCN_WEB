          A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles
          at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes about 42 muscles to
          smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the comer
          of the eyes, an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed
          without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
